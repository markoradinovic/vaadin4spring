Vaadin + Spring = AWESOME
=========================

This add-on adds support for Vaadin to Spring and Spring Boot, or Spring support to Vaadin,
depending on your point of view ;-).

## Quick start ##

First, you need to get this add-on installed into your local Maven repository:

1. Clone this repository: ```$ git clone https://github.com/peholmst/vaadin4spring.git```
2. Change into the root directory of the working copy and run: ```mvn clean install```

When this is done, you need to create your actual application project. The easiest way is to go to http://start.spring.io and
fill in the necessary details. Make sure you at least select the **Web** style. Then download the generated project as a **Maven Project** and
open it up in your favorite IDE.

Now it is time to add this add-on. Add the following dependencies to your ```pom.xml``` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.vaadin.spring</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-vaadin</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
   <artifactId>vaadin-themes</artifactId>
   <version>7.1.10</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
   <artifactId>vaadin-client-compiled</artifactId>
   <version>7.1.10</version>
</dependency>
```

Finally, you can create your Vaadin UI. Create a new UI class in your project and annotate it with ```@VaadinUI``` e.g. like this:

```java
@VaadinUI
public class MyVaadinUI extends UI {
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
        setContent(new Label("Hello! I'm the root UI!"));
    }
}
```

Run the ```main(String[])``` method in the generated ```Application``` class and point your browser to http://localhost:8080 . Voila!

## Configuring the Vaadin servlet ##

By default, the Vaadin servlet is mapped to ```/*```. If you are only exposing your application as a web UI, this is good enough, but if you want
REST endpoints as well, you need to change this mapping. You can do this by creating a file named ```application.properties``` in the
```src/main/resources```directory and add the following property to it: ```vaadin.servlet.urlMapping=/myUI/*```

The Vaadin servlet init parameters can also be configured in this way. Just prefix the name of the init parameter with ```vaadin.servlet.params.```. For
example, to turn on production mode, you would add ```vaadin.servlet.params.productionMode=true``` to the file.

## Customizing the Vaadin servlet ##

TODO

## The UI Scope ##

This add-on provides a custom scope that binds the bean to the current UI instance. You can use it by adding the ```@UIScope``` annotation to the bean.
The lifecycle of the bean will automatically follow the lifecycle of the UI instance, so you can also use ```@PostConstruct``` and ```@PreDestroy```.
Please note, however, that UI scoped beans cannot currently be ```ApplicationListener```s. Also, no Vaadin components can be proxied.

## Navigator API integration ##

This add-on provides support for the Vaadin Navigator API. To use it:

1. Annotate your views with ```@VaadinView``` and make them either ```ui``` scoped or ```prototype``` scoped.
2. Inject an instance of ```SpringViewProvider``` into your UI and add it as a view provider to your ```Navigator``` instance.

Please see the JavaDocs and the sample application for more information.

## Security Support ##

The Spring Security integration is still in very early stages of development. Do not assume it will work, and don't use
it in your projects until the supported features are listed in this README.

/**
 * Annotation to be placed on {@link com.vaadin.navigator.View}-classes that should be
 * handled by the {@link SpringViewProvider}.
 * <p/>
 * This annotation is also a stereotype annotation, so Spring will automatically detect the annotated classes.
 * <b>However, the scope must be explicitly specified as the default singleton scope will not work!</b> You can use
 * the {@code prototype} scope or the {@link org.vaadin.spring.UIScope ui} scope.
 * <p/>
 * This is an example of a view that is mapped to an empty view name and is available for all UI subclasses in the application:
 * <code>
 *     <pre>
 *     &#64;VaadinView(name = "")
 *     &#64;UIScope
 *     public class MyDefaultView extends CustomComponent implements View {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     </pre>
 * </code>
 * This is an example of a view that is only available to a specified UI subclass:
 * <code>
 *     <pre>
 *     &#64;VaadinView(name = "myView", ui = MyUI.class)
 *     &#64;UIScope
 *     public class MyView extends CustomComponent implements View {
 *         // ...

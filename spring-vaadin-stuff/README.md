Vaadin4Spring Stuff
===================

The Stuff module contains Spring-optimized versions of different classes and utilities that I often end up 
re-implementing in my projects. Feel free to use the features listed in this README in your projects, but please
consider this module slightly less stable (in terms of API) than the other modules in Vaadin4Spring.
